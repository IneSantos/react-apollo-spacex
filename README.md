# React Apollo SpaceX dashboard

This project consists of a web application that allows users to see a list of the last 10 lanches provided by the [SpaceX Graphql API](https://api.spacex.land/graphql/) and see the missions in detail on a separate route.


## Decision process

To build this application I decided to use Create React App since I'm already familiar with React and it is a fairly simple and complete way to start a project. 
Personally, I chose to take the extra step and add Typescript to the code since it makes the code more manageable and helped me spot issues earlier. 
My thought process behind the folder splitting was that, this way if the project grew to a larger and more complex project it would be easy to do so.
All the design was developed by me, I opted-out using any design framework.

If I was given more time I would have liked to add more information into the mission view and improved the design. 
Any questions please don't hesitate to contact me.

## Setup instructions

Since this project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) all the scripts are detailed below. 


---

After downloading the project don't forget to run  `npm install`

---



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
